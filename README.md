# Academic Records System

A minimal PHP app demonstrating CRUD operations with a text file backend. No database setup is required.

**Quick start**
1. Place `crudSystem` in your PHP web root.
2. Ensure `students.txt` is writable by the server.
3. Open `http://localhost/crudSystem/` and use the form to manage students.

**Features**
- Create, view, edit, and delete student records.
- Registration number field is mandatory and unique.
- Success alerts shown after each action.

**Important files**
- `index.php`, `create.php`, `edit.php`, `delete.php` – main pages
- `assets/style.css` – styling
- `students.txt` – data file (auto‑created)

That’s it—simple and easy to modify.
